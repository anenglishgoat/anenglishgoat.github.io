# **About Me**
I have recently submitted my PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics at the University of Birmingham. My PhD work focuses on statistical and probabilistic methods for single-cell data. I have also consulted in statistics/mathematical modelling for Procter & Gamble and a cash logistics startup. I'll (hopefully) be joining Dave Smith's group as a postdoc to work on methods for improving the outcomes of fertility treatment using data and video.

Outside of acadaemia, I like football, poker, poems, Twitter and guitars. I'll post some football-related stuff here. My main interests in football analytics are (eventually) making tracking data freely available through collaboration on open source computer vision projects, trying to encourage people to care about uncertainty and regularisation, and horribly over-ambitious possession models.
